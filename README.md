# Chatterbox
👉Real-time communication is a core requirement of modern web applications such as chat platforms, collaboration tools, and live dashboards.

👉Traditional HTTP-based communication is not suitable for real-time interactions due to its request–response nature.

👉WebSockets enable persistent, low-latency, bidirectional communication between client and server.

👉This project, Chatterbox, demonstrates the practical implementation of a real-time chat application using FastAPI and WebSockets.
