# Chatterbox
Real-time communication is a core requirement of modern web applications such as chat platforms, collaboration tools, and live dashboards.

Traditional HTTP-based communication is not suitable for real-time interactions due to its request–response nature.

WebSockets enable persistent, low-latency, bidirectional communication between client and server.

This project, Chatterbox, demonstrates the practical implementation of a real-time chat application using FastAPI and WebSockets.
